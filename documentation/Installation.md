# OCI Designer Toolkit Installation Guide

Although OKIT can simply be downloaded and the command line executed it is recommended that it be executed within a
docker container that can be built using the Dockerfile within this repository. This will guarantee that all the required 
python modules are installed and in addition provide a simple flask server that will present the web based application on
[http://localhost/okit/designer](http://localhost/okit/designer).

## OCI Connection Information

If you already have the OCI sdk/cli installed on you machine you can use the previously generated pem key and config file
we will assume that this exists in &lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci 

### Key File

If you do not have a previously generated private key you will need to create a private/public key pair for use with OKIT and OCI.
These keys can be generated using the following commands as defined in [Required Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).

```bash
openssl genrsa -out <USER HOME DIR>/.oci/oci_api_key.pem 2048   
openssl rsa -pubout -in <USER HOME DIR>/.oci/oci_api_key.pem -out <USER HOME DIR>/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem                                  
```

Upload the generated __oci_api_key_public.pem__ to OCI through the [console](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm) and record the associated fingerprint following upload.

### Config File

Create the OCI cli __config__ file in the directory __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ with contents similar to that below.
The __*key_file*__ is a fixed value because the contents of the __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ will be mounted to the
appropriate users home directory, as __~/.oci__, during the run process.

```properties
[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaak6z......
fingerprint=3b:7e:37:ec:a0:86:1....
key_file=~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem  
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaawpqblfem........
region=us-phoenix-1
```
Further information on the config file can be found on the OCI sdk page [SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm).










## Quick Start Runtime

Docker is the recommended runtime container for OKIT and the project contains a top-level Dockerfile to facilitate direct
building, of the runtime environment, from the docker command line.

### Build Docker Container
```bash
docker build --tag okit --force-rm https://github.com/oracle/oci-designer-toolkit.git
```

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 80:80 --volume <USER HOME DIR>/okit/user/templates:/okit/templates --volume <USER HOME DIR>/.oci:/root/.oci --name okit okit
```

Once started the Designer BUI can be accessed on [http://localhost/okit/designer](http://localhost/okit/designer)










## Build from Source

### OKIT Repository
Before the building either the Docker or Vagrant Images the project will need to be cloned, or downloaded, from the GitHub 
Repository.  

#### Clone
The command shows how this can be cloned to the local machine.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:oracle/oci-designer-toolkit.git
```

or 

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/oracle/oci-designer-toolkit.git
```

#### Update
If you have previously cloned the GitHub Repository you can update to the latest release by pulling it from the repository 
with the following command.

```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit
git pull
```

#### Download
If you do not have git installed locally the current release of OKIT can be retrieved by downloading it as a zip file from
[https://github.com/oracle/oci-designer-toolkit/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/oracle/oci-designer-toolkit/archive/master.zip)


### Create Container

Before building/rebuilding your chosen container you will need to copy the contents of [&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci](#config-file) 
to the __oci-designer-toolkit/containers/oci__ directory.

#### Docker Compose
The docker image is the recommended runtime server OKIT provides a simple Docker Compose script to build and start the container.

##### Docker Compose Build
```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit/containers/docker
docker-compose up --detach
```

##### Docker Compose Update
```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit/containers/docker
docker-compose stop
docker-compose build
```

#### Docker 
The docker image  can be built and started using the scripts in the docker sub directory.
It should be noted that the current Docker script is designed for development purposes and mounts the source directories
at runtime. 

##### Docker Build
```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit
docker build --tag okit --file ./containers/docker/Dockerfile --force-rm .
```
##### Docker Update
```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit
docker rmi okit
docker build --tag okit --file ./containers/docker/Dockerfile --force-rm .
```
##### Start Docker Container
```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit
docker run -d --rm -p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
           --name okit \
           --hostname okit \
           --volume ~/okit/user/templates:/okit/templates \
           okit
```

#### Vagrant
##### Prerequisites
1. Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/)
##### Vagrant Build
```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit/containers/vagrant/
vagrant up; vagrant reload; vagrant ssh
```
**NOTE**: This step takes about 30 minutes on my mac when you build the VM, a little longer the first time as the Vbox image 
is downloaded from github. Once the VM is built the vagrant up should just take a few seconds.
##### Vagrant
```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit/containers/vagrant
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy -f
vagrant up
vagrant reload
```










## Install on OCI Instance
```diff
- THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED BUT THESE NOTES ARE FOR THOSE WHO INSIST ON TRYING THIS
- THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW TO CONFIGURE OKIT WITH INSTANCE PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONALITY.
```
To install OKIT and run it within an OCI instance you will need to configure [Instance Principal](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm)
functionality within your Tenancy to allow the OKIT Instance to access OCI API and Query the Tenancy / Access Resource Manager.

When creating the Instance it is recommended the Instance is within its own Virtual Cloud Network / Subnet. The Subnet should 
be secured with a Security List that __only__ allows TCP/22 port access to the Instance to allow the configuration of a [SSH Tunnel](#ssh-tunnel)
to restrict access to the Instance to authorised users. 

Once the Instance has been created the following commands will install OKIT and create the service to run the WebServer.
```bash
# Install Required Packages because the packages section may not complete before the runcmd
sudo bash -c "yum install -y git python-oci-cli oci-utils"
# Install Required Python Modules
sudo bash -c "pip3 install --no-cache-dir flask==1.1.1 gunicorn==20.0.4 oci==2.22.0 oci-cli==2.14.1 pandas==1.1.2 python-magic==0.4.18 pyyaml==5.2 requests==2.24.0 xlsxwriter==1.3.6"
# Clone OKIT
sudo bash -c "git clone -b master --depth 1 https://github.com/oracle/oci-designer-toolkit.git /okit"
sudo bash -c "mkdir /okit/{log,workspace}"
# Add additional environment information because append does not appear to work in write_file
sudo bash -c "echo 'export OCI_CLI_AUTH=instance_principal' >> /etc/bashrc"
sudo bash -c "echo 'export OKIT_VM_COMPARTMENT=`oci-metadata -g "compartmentID" --value-only`' >> /etc/bashrc"
# Copy GUnicorn Service File
sudo bash -c 'sed "s/{COMPARTMENT_OCID}/`oci-metadata -g compartmentID --value-only`/" /okit/containers/services/gunicorn.service > /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service'
# Enable Gunicorn Service
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.service
sudo systemctl start gunicorn.service
```

The __okit-ws.json__ file in the containers/cloud sub-directory can be used to create vcn/subnet/instance.

### Dynamic Group
A Tenancy level Dynamic Group will need to be created to enable Instance Principal access for the instance.
#### OKITInstanceGroup
Create the OKITInstanceGroup Dynamic Group and add a single Rule relating to the OKIT Instance.
![OKIT Dynamic Group](images/DynamicGroup.png?raw=true "OKIT Dynamic Group")

### Policies
Tenancy level policies will need to be created for the Dynamic Group and depending on the required level of access either
the Query or Resource Manager level policies defined below should be specified.
#### Query
```text
Allow dynamic-group OKITInstanceGroup to read all-resources in tenancy
Allow dynamic-group OKITInstanceGroup to use instances in tenancy
```
#### Resource Manager
```text
Allow dynamic-group OKITInstanceGroup to manage orm-stacks in tenancy
Allow dynamic-group OKITInstanceGroup to manage orm-jobs in tenancy
Allow dynamic-group OKITInstanceGroup to manage all-resources in tenancy
```
#### OKITInstancePrincipal
Create the OKITInstancePrincipal Policy and add either the Query or Resource Manager Policies.
![OKIT Dynamic Group Policies](images/DynamicGroupPolicies.png?raw=true "OKIT Dynamic Group Policies")

### SSH Tunnel
```bash
ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -N -L 8080:127.0.0.1:80 opc@<Instance IP> -i <Private Key File>
```

Once the tunnel has been created the OKIT Designer BUI can be accessed on [http://localhost:8080/okit/designer](http://localhost:8080/okit/designer).
